# Kollokvium (colloquium)

## About

Engaging in digital meetings should be simple, secure and not require installation of software, just a browser and an internet connection.

Unnecessary logins, user registrations and data should not flow through third parties, but between the peers involved in the meeting, this makes the connection private and also resilient against overloaded servers that applications like skype and discord may experience under high load, which often happens in a crisis.

> Our digital meetings should be flexible, resilient and protected!

Kollokvium target companies, associations and individuals, both young and old, perhaps especially those without any deeper computer experience as it requires no installation or signup and can be started simply by following a link and clicking start.

Unlike many other video conferencing technologies we passes everyoneâ€™s Media Streams to all participants, rather than sending the to a central media server for mixing the streams, The result is lower latency, better quality, privacy and security, as data flow P2P , there is now middleman involved, except in the setup phase of the room's (negotiation), not nothing is stored at server(s)  and data is ofcourse encrypted, our server is just a message broker (signaling and state of rooms) . 

The system uses standardized native technologies such as WebRTC, the open standard for Web communication. We also leverage the power of the technology already in our end-users hands - don't reinvent the wheel again!

Our implementation adds advanced video routing concepts such as stream forwarding, bandwidth estimations and many other things.

See package.json ( scripts section/object)

## Quick deploy guides

## Local development

Build and and launch using `npm start` and then browse to `localhost:1337` or for frontend only development use `npm start:debug` which is much smoother. Pleaase note
that npm start:debug is using a shared wss server hosted by us by default. please study scripts sections of `package.json` for futher information.

### Azure deploy
To deploy to Azure you need an Azure account, and you need to create an Azure Wep Application, and a storage account to host the Static Website.

### Heroku apps
Fork the repository and connect to Heroku and run deploy, modify settings.json

### Deploy front end only 
If you want to deploy only the front-end as a static site, build the application and copy all the files from dist/client folder to the root of you web application.
